# Scrivo

Scrivo is a next-generation lightweight markup language designed for simplicity, extensibility, and semantic structure. It builds on the best parts of Markdown while addressing many of its limitations.

## 💡 Simplicity

Scrivo uses intuitive syntax that is easy to read, write, and understand. The textual source documents look much like their rendered output. 

## ➕ Extensibility

Scrivo provides multiple extension points for plugins, pre/post-processors, and syntax customizations. Developers can expand Scrivo to new domains and use cases.

## 🏗️ Semantic Structure

Scrivo generates semantically structured HTML using elements like header, section, and article during rendering. This improves accessibility, SEO, and reuse.

## 🛡️ Safety

Scrivo sanitizes and escapes HTML from all sources to prevent XSS and injection attacks. You can author content safely without security expertise.

## 🚚 Portability

Scrivo is distributed as a single npm package running in Browser and Node.js. It can be used across projects and platforms. Output renders gracefully across devices and browsers.

## 💻 Developer Friendly

Scrivo supports component libraries like React and Vue out of the box. It fits seamlessly into modern web development workflows.
